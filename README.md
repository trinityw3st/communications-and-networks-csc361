# Communications and Networks csc361 

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the **TCP/IP protocol stack**, the foundation of modern Internet communication. It explains how networks connect devices and systems globally, covering both the theoretical concepts and practical mechanisms that enable data exchange across the Internet. The course begins with an overview of Internet architecture, access and backbone technologies, and the key services and protocols that allow seamless interaction between networks.

It then explores the major layers of the TCP/IP model in depth. The **application layer** section covers the client-server model, HTTP, DNS, and socket programming. The **transport layer** focuses on communication reliability and efficiency through TCP and UDP, including connection management and flow, error, and congestion control. The **network layer** introduces IP addressing, routing algorithms, and Internet routing protocols, while the **link layer** delves into MAC techniques, link interworking, and IEEE 802.3/802.11 standards. Together, these topics provide a clear understanding of how data moves securely and efficiently across the Internet.
